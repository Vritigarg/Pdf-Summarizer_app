LangChain End to End LLM Project | PDF Summarization Tool

Using Langchain build a PDF summarization tool which using Hugging Face Embeddings retrieves the response which matches our query.
main.py is the User Interface 
utils.py is the Logic behind the application

The User Interface Looks like this 
![pdf_summarizer_app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3633c462-7b46-488b-9b55-f2bab4b90ef4)

You have to use your own OpenAI API Key. THE API key which I have used is not paid, but the basic Logic behind the Application remains same and the Interface remains the same.

To run the main.py file in the terminal write
streamlit run main.py , this will take you to the localhost of your browser
